Final Project: Personal Portfolio

This final project is a restructuring of my portfolio and
also a test for using Vue.js and the DOM.

This project uses a plethora of HTML5 elements and
has both a linked stylesheet and styles for individual pages

The protfolio work page is a single page app that injects my
portfolio pieces into the body and then activates the javascript within them
for gallary view and for loading javascript only content

In the event that javascript is disabled, alternative images would be presentes
to still show the work being presented.

Has been tested in Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Opera with both javascript on and off

One issue I couldn't figure out is when javascript is enabled, it brought the nav bar to the left and in block display when originally it was inline-block

Another issue observed is that when scrolling through the gallery and then refreshing the page, it hides the current image and does not reset the image to it's first index

I also couldn't figure out why the portfolio work link font was smaller then the other links but only on mobile devices.
